1) Opening and Reading a txt file
    
     link=open('/content/dummy.txt','r')             # r = read mode (we can use w (write), r(read) or a(append)) #file is opened here (  dummy is not data)
     data = link.read()                              #all the data is stored in the data (the complete txt file) # file is read here
     print(link.name)                                 #gives the name with path
     print(link.mode)                                #tells the mode in which the file 

     print(link.closed)                              #checks whether a file has been closed or not 

2) Closing a text file
 
    link.close()                                      #it is always important to close the file which is openend so that the resources used in opening that file could be freed (system)
    
    
3) Alternative method of reading a file 
    with open('/content/demo.txt','r') as link:           #this works like a loop outside the loop the file automatically closes (we need not write another statement to close it
        print(link.read())
        print(link.name)
        print(link.mode)
        print(link.closed)
    print(link.closed)


4) Storing each line in a list of the file
    with open('/content/demo.txt','r') as file:
        print(file.readlines())                                           #readlines reads line by line and stores the different lines as a different element in the list



Writing in a text files
  with open('/content/demo.txt','a') as link:                         #'a' will write to the end of the original file
    link.writelines(["\nhello\n","world"])                          #writes in the original file
    link.write("hello world")
    
    
 5) 
 with open('/content/demo.txt','a') as link:
  with open('/content/demo2.txt','r') as link2:                   #this codde will read from demo2 and write in the file demo "loop" is a kind of syntax file open and close ke liye 
    link.writelines(link2.read())
