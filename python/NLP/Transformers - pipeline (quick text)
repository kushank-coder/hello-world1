From transformers import pipeline   #pipeline module does set of preprocessing and set of post processing for many of the textual tasks

#refer this link for all the tasks that can be defined by pipeline operator   = https://huggingface.co/models  


# Just give the task to the pipeline module and model.
# Always a good idea to mention the model that is being utilized (refer hugging face for diff models)
 

1) classifier = pipeline(“sentiment-analysis”)  #sentiment analysis (it takes by default model from hugging face)
 

eg. Classifier(“We are planning to move to transformers library”) #=> it will give the sentiment and the score for this line

 

2) Classifier = pipeline(“zero-shot-classification”) # simple text classification
#input text and labels and the pipeline operator will give probabilities in descending order (it will automatically classify the text into labels)


eg. Classifier(“This is a course about how the transformers work”,Candidate_labels = [“machine learning”,”sports”,”finance”,”electrical engineering”]) 

#it will give probabilities class wise 
 

3) Generator = pipeline(“text-generation”)  # Text Generation (completing a sentence, paragraph etc)
Generator(“nifty is bullish today because”) ….it will generate probable next words

 
4) #missing word generator use <mask> key
Unmasker= pipeline(“fill-mask”) #Fill in best probable words
eg. Unmasker(“This course will teach you all about <mask> models.”,top_k=2)

# will give (top 2) the best word estimate on the space <mask>


5) Ner = pipeline(“ner”,grouped_entities= True) # Named entity recognition in text
$will give diff types of named entity  recognition
eg. Ner(“My name is sylvain.”)

 
6) QA = pipeline(“question-answering”) # give question answering task . give question and context the model will give the answer
QA(question=”Where do I work?”,Context= “My Name is sylvain and I work at hugging face”)

 
7) Summarizer = pipeline(“summarization”)  # summarization
Summarizer(“Text”)  # will summarize the Text in fewer lines

8) Translator = pipeline(“translation”) # translate from one language to another
Translator(“TEXT”)
